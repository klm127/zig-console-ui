# Zig Console UI

This library aims to create abstractions for creating console UIs, such as menus, input boxes, and so forth, to create more elegant console applications.

It leverages Virtual Terminal Escape Sequences to place colored characters at necessary locations in the terminal.

It is primarily a learning exercise for improving my ability to use Zig, but I do intend to make it useful.
